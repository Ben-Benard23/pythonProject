#PYTHON TUPLES Please do list first to understand tuples
#These are similar to list.
# 1)List are mutable while tuples are imutable
# 2) items in a tuple are in parentensis while list are in square brackets

#example
# numbers = (21, -5, 6 ,9)
# print(numbers)  # =(21, -5, 6, 9)
# print(numbers[2])  #access item on index 2 = 6
# print(numbers[:2])  # slice including the first index  = (21, -5)
# print(numbers[1:5])  # slice from index 1 to the end = (-5, 6, 9)
# for numbers in numbers:  #iterate  the list
#     print(numbers)
